# eCommerce---Django
This is not actually an eCommerce website.

This is a raw website which displays the basic functionality of **logging in** , **signup** , **logout** , **sending emails to the host 
as soon as someone fills the form** and also **integrated paypal to purchase things**

## How it works
1. Clone this repository.
2. Now navigate to the folder where you cloned this repo.
3. Run this command **python manage.py runserver**.
4. Now navigate to your local host using the link you get after running the server.
5. Your are good to go 

### This is a raw website and only displays some useful functionality that every eCommerce website has.
